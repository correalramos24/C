Just **C++** applications with **CMake** compilation environment.

Aims to be used for trying CTest and also the deploy of the CI/CD pipelines.

## Ideas to implement again

* Random numbers generator (for uses as input files)

* Sorting algorithms (as a Class)

* Pi computation

* Fibonnaci (with dynamic programming)
