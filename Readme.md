# CPlusPlus

Just **C++** applications with **CMake** compilation environment.

Aims to be used for trying CTest and also the deploy of the CI/CD pipelines.

## Ideas to implement again

* Random numbers generator (for uses as input files)

* Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, counting sort)

* Pi computation (OMP and MPI)

* Fibonnaci (with dynamic programming)

* Some *stencil* with dependencies
  

## Utils to implement: 

* Timing functions (in pure C)
* logging functions (in pure C)
